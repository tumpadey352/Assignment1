        <p>My hometown is a beautiful city. It is both traditional and contemporary, maintained by the number of people, and different kinds of tribes.<br>
             I moved to Grand Bassa when I was nine years old. My mom took me there because I was the kind of person who never understood the traditional cultures, and religious.<br>
         I love my hometown so much because it is where I got to know many new things and interact with different kinds of people.<br> I love everythingâ€™s about my hometown which includes the farm, traditional houses, the warm air, and the peaceful surrounding that has lovely people.</p>
